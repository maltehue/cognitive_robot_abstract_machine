"""
Terminal-state prediction constraint and enforcement strategy for linearized MPC.

The :class:`TerminalStatePredictionStrategy` builds a single equality constraint row that drives
the MPC-predicted value of a scalar state at the end of the control horizon to a target value.
The prediction is obtained by linearizing the state's first-order ODE at the current operating
point and unrolling the discrete-time recursion analytically, so the terminal state is a linear
function of the joint velocity decision variables — compatible with the existing PIQP quadratic
solver.

The mechanism is domain-agnostic: any scalar state governed by ``ẋ = f(x, q)`` whose terminal
value should reach a goal (e.g. a container fill level driven by a tilt or a valve angle) can use
it by supplying the symbolic state velocity and the passive state variable.

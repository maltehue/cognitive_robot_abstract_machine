"""
Abstract Base Class for Task-Achieving Body Motion Predicates.

This module defines the interface for implementing the three predicates from the
Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion paper. Different problem domains can provide
their own implementations:

- Motion planning: Execute motion statecharts to observe effects
- Fluid simulation: Use probabilistic models for pouring tasks
- Language/AI: Use LLM or learned models to reason about task-effect relationships

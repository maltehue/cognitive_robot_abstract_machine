"""Pouring equations whose head-above-lip is a learned l4casadi model.

Identical to the analytic equations except ``head_above_lip`` evaluates a trained surrogate.
Because l4casadi accepts CasADi SX (giskardpy's backend), the learned head returns an SX-backed
:class:`~krrood.symbolic_math.symbolic_math.Scalar` and flows through ``symbolic_velocity``,
``exit_velocity``, the transfer gate, the projectile landing, and the terminal-state prediction
exactly like the analytic head -- no controller changes.

Neither a torch module nor the compiled l4casadi wrapper can cross a process boundary, so the
equations carry a :class:`LearnedHeadModelReference` instead: a serializable descriptor from which
every process (client or server, on any machine running the same workspace) rematerializes the
model locally on first use. This mirrors how
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.world_description.connections.LiquidTransferCoupling` survives
world synchronization while the symbolic coupling is rebuilt per world.

..note:: :mod:`torch` and :mod:`l4casadi` are imported lazily inside the materialization step,
    so this module (and everything that deserializes worlds containing these equations) stays
    importable without them until a learned head is actually evaluated.
